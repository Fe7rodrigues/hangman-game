About
-----
<p>This project is the second challenge of the ONE - Oracle Next Education project, a hangman game made with HTML, CSS and Javascript</p>
<p>I've always liked this game and it was really cool to be able to make my own, I'm very happy with the result. I found the site very beautiful and it met my expectations for the project.</p>
<p>At first I was looking for an API to get the words, but I didn't find any that worked for me. So I found a list with more than 2,000 words and I made an array.</p>
<p>O brilho do programa pra mim está no teclado, construí-lo foi relativamente simples e ficou muito intuitivo e bonito.</p>

How to use
---------
<p>You can access the site by clicking<a href="https://fe7rodrigues.github.io/hangman_game/">aqui</a> ou abrindo o arquivo HTML em um navegador.</p>
<p>Right from the start a word will be drawn and you can try to find out which one it is, you have 6 attempts to get the word right.</p>
<p>At each end of the game, the correct word will be shown and you will be able to play again with another word drawn by clicking on the "Play again" button.</p>
